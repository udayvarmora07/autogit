# Phase 0 contract acceptance record

Status: Accepted for the implementation baseline; release posture remains
NO-GO until the remaining safety, native-matrix, and release gates pass.

Accepted by: Uday Varmora

## Scope

This record accepts the normative implementation baseline and terminology used
by the following documents. It does not approve a private alpha, public beta,
live provider canary, or release artifact.

| Accepted area | Normative document | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product requirements | [product requirements](product-requirements.md) | Must-level requirements and traceability checks |
| Lifecycle state and transitions | [lifecycle](lifecycle.md) | Lifecycle reducer and replay tests |
| Wire/event contract | [event contract](event-contract.md) | JSON schema, decode, adapter, receipt, and causal replay tests |
| Threat model and invariants | [threat model](threat-model.md) | Security, ownership, process, and provider-boundary tests |
| Compatibility window | [contract freeze](contract-freeze.md) and [compatibility manifest](compatibility-manifest.json) | Versioned event/result/state compatibility checks |
| Release terminology | [contract freeze](contract-freeze.md) and [release runbook](release-runbook.md) | Evidence/status language and explicit NO-GO gates |

The acceptance is limited to the stated baseline. A document or command must
not infer phase promotion from this record; promotion still requires the
phase-specific evidence listed in [todo.md](../todo.md).
